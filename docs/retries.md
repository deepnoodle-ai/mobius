# SDK Retry & Rate-Limit Handling

The Mobius API may respond to any authenticated request with `429 Too Many
Requests` when a rate-limit bucket is exhausted, or `503 Service Unavailable`
when the backend is transiently overloaded. All official SDKs (Go, Python,
TypeScript) share the same retry semantics so that customer behavior is
consistent across languages.

This document is the authoritative spec. If one language drifts from it,
that language has a bug.

## Scope

The retry layer sits **below** the generated client and wraps every outbound
request. It observes only the response status code and a small set of
headers; it does not inspect request or response bodies.

## Retryable status codes

Only the following statuses trigger a retry:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate-limit exceeded for the credential or org. |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | Backend signalling transient unavailability. |

Any other status — including `500`, `502`, and `504` — is **not** retried.
(Those can indicate half-applied writes; the caller decides how to handle.)

Network-level errors (DNS failure, connection reset, I/O timeout) are also
**not** retried automatically. Callers that want to retry network errors
should do so at the application layer.

## Idempotency gating

Retrying a non-idempotent write risks creating duplicates. The SDK retries
only when the request is safe to replay:

- `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE` — always retried on retryable statuses.
- `POST` — retried **only** when the request carries an `Idempotency-Key`
  header. A `POST` without that header is never retried; on `429` the SDK
  surfaces `RateLimitError` immediately.
- `PATCH` — treated like `POST`: retried only with `Idempotency-Key`.

## Backoff

For each retry the SDK sleeps a bounded number of seconds, chosen as:

1. If the response carries `Retry-After`, parse it:
   - integer number of seconds, **or**
   - HTTP-date (RFC 7231) — delta = date − now.
2. Otherwise fall back to exponential backoff: `1s`, `2s`, `4s`, ...
   (doubling each attempt).
3. In all cases clamp the per-attempt wait to `[0, 60s]`. A server that asks
   for a 600s wait is ignored beyond the cap; callers that want to honor
   very long waits should disable SDK retries and implement their own
   policy.

The context/`AbortSignal` passed by the caller is respected during sleep —
cancellation aborts the retry loop with the cancellation error.

## Retry budget

- Default: **3 retries** per request (so up to 4 total attempts).
- Configurable by the caller: `0` disables retries, any positive integer is
  permitted.
- When retries are exhausted, or when retrying is not allowed (see
  [idempotency gating](#idempotency-gating)), the SDK raises a typed
  `RateLimitError` populated from the last response's headers.

`503` retries that eventually give up do **not** wrap into `RateLimitError`
— the SDK passes the underlying response through so the caller's existing
status handling applies.

## `RateLimitError` shape

All three SDKs expose the same fields (naming follows language conventions):

| Field | Type | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| `retry_after` | duration (or seconds) | `Retry-After` header; `0` if absent |
| `limit` | integer | `X-RateLimit-Limit` header |
| `remaining` | integer | `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header |
| `reset_at` | timestamp | `X-RateLimit-Reset` (Unix seconds) |
| `scope` | string (`"key"` / `"org"`) | `X-RateLimit-Scope` header |

The backend also emits `X-RateLimit-Policy` describing the policy
(`"<limit>;w=<seconds>"`). SDKs surface it on the error for diagnostics but
do not rely on it for control flow.

The error's message is stable:

```
mobius: rate limit exceeded (scope=<scope>, retry after <N>s)
```

### Error wrapping

Each SDK surfaces `RateLimitError` in a way idiomatic for that language:

- **Go** — `*RateLimitError` unwraps to the sentinel `ErrRateLimited`, so
  `errors.Is(err, mobius.ErrRateLimited)` keeps working for existing
  callers. New callers can `errors.As(err, &rle)` for the rich fields.
- **Python** — `RateLimitError` subclasses `Exception`. The pre-existing
  `RateLimitedError` (emitted from custom events) is kept as an alias for
  backward compatibility with the 0.0.x release line.
- **TypeScript** — `RateLimitError` extends `Error` and is thrown from the
  wrapped `fetch`.

## Defaults summary

| Knob | Default |
|------|---------|
| Retry statuses | `{429, 503}` |
| Retries | `3` |
| Retry non-idempotent POST on 429 | no (surface error) |
| Max sleep per attempt | `60s` |
| Exp backoff base | `1s`, doubled each attempt |

## Disabling retries

Set the per-client knob to `0`:

- Go: `mobius.NewClient(..., mobius.WithRetry(0))`
- Python: `Client(..., retry=0)`
- TypeScript: `new Client({ ..., retry: 0 })`

With retries disabled, every 429 surfaces as `RateLimitError`, immediately.

## What the server expects

The backend assumes well-behaved clients will sleep per `Retry-After` before
the next request. A client that ignores `Retry-After` and retries
aggressively will just get more 429s — the bucket doesn't refill
mid-window. The SDK retry layer exists precisely so customers don't have to
think about this.

## Worker claim loop

The Go worker (`mobius/worker.go`) runs its own loop above the transport,
so the 60-second transport cap does not apply: when the transport
surfaces a `RateLimitError`, the worker sleeps the server-provided
`RetryAfter` before re-claiming, clamped to `MaxClaimRateLimitSleep`
(5 minutes). On any other claim error it falls back to a 2-second
backoff. The clamp keeps a runaway header from pinning a worker for
hours and bounds the time before context cancellation takes effect;
when the actual window is longer than the clamp, the next claim
returns a fresh `429` with the remaining `Retry-After`, so the worker
sleeps again — bounded polling, not a hot loop.

The Python and TypeScript worker loops should mirror this: honor
`RetryAfter` after a 429 instead of using a uniform error backoff.
